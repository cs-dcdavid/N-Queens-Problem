Using backtracking search with forward checking, this Python program by DC David finds a solution for the n-Queens Puzzle for up to n=52.

### Overview of the n-Queens Puzzle
The n-Queens puzzle is the problem of placing 'n' chess queens on an n-by-n chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Solutions exist for all natural numbers n with the exception of n = 2 and n = 3. The 8-Queens puzzle is a more specific example of the n-Queens problem of placing eight non-attacking queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard.
